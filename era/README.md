# Mission
Evolving across the decades, today the mission of **ezlog** remains to:

(1) Allow us to use any **C**ommand **L**ine User **I**nterface (**CLI**) to maintain our events & messages in readily editable text files.

(2) Permit us to work on those files between that **CLI** and a cross-platform **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface (**GUI**.)

(3) Do other [creative things](http://soft9000.com) whilst I am in between [consulting 'gigs](https://linkedin.com/in/nagyspace).

Here is an overview of what [AboutTime can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohJfGX-EjoU).


## Project Notes
The **EzLog Project** can be re-created wherever the GNU toolchain is installed. If you are looking to continue to create '.ezlog' files, note the new "posix" and "windows" targets in the [Makefile](cpp_ezlog/Makefile) for building [cpp_ezlog](cpp_ezlog/ezcon.cpp). 

If you are do not know how to use GNU Make, Makefiles, or simply need a quick review then you can enroll in our [The GNU Make and C++ Programmer's Primer](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-gnu-tool-primer/?referralCode=E858B2C2AC9CD872A100) educational opportunity.

## AboutTime: EzLog GUI
The Ezlog C/C++ logging application updates an `.ezlog` file. The `.ezlog` file can also be monitored & updated in real-time from Java using the [AboutTime Desktop](https://github.com/soft9000/AboutTime/tree/master/AboutTimeDesktop) GUI.

## The `ezlog` Project
Binding it all together, the `ezlog` project is about simple &amp; effective date, time, and modern ezlog-style logging @ the console.
