<!DOCTYPE html><html><title>Project Overview</title><body><h1>ï»¿Mission Statement</h1>
<p>The "era" Namespace is a modernization of the key components from my classic "Able1" and "stdnoj" Namespaces.</p>

<h2>Historicals</h2>

<p>In a time when there were no standard container, string, and RFC support available (NNTP, SMTP, REC822, etc.), the mission of the stdnoj & Able1 namespaces were to support basic collection, communication, and RFC-client required by our commercial C/C++ applications. </p>

<p>Conceived in 1998, stdnoj leveraged the standardization efforts of the time. Relying primarily upon POSIX as well as the Standard C Library, the stdnoj namespace was designed for cross-platform (Win32/POSIX) use under the industries earliest C/C++ conventions.</p>

<p>Forming the basis for several commercial products (including FileSpy, EzInstall, Timezone, News*NET, and EzGourmet) stdnoj and Able1 are both time proven, as well as thoroughly tested. --We even used the namespaces to create several "robots" designed to manage our opt-in enewsletter community of over 2,500 recipe and quotation lovers!</p>

<h2>Modernization</h2>

<p>With the advent of C++11, the opportunity to port our efforts to Modern C++ began with the creation of our "GNU C++ for Professionals" training opportunity. Herein known as the era Namespace, our initial efforts are focusing upon the ports required for supporting that training opportunity. </p>

<h3>Project: EZLOG (1Q/2017)</h3>

<p>The first target provides the simple date, time, and logging support so as to host a modernized "ezlog" console-logging application.</p>

<p>Please see the cpp/Makefile for more information.</p>
