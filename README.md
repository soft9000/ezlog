# What is ezlog?
Created & shared back in 1998, the original ezlog logging legacy - lives on!

Part of my classic [AboutTime Desktop Application](https://github.com/soft9000/AboutTime), I've also used ezlog to demonstrate fast & easy logging techniques across Java, Python, PHP, C#, VB.Net, and yes - as well as several incarnations of the C/C++ Standard. 

From oil & gas compaines, cloud, banking, and skype - to the DoD - you'll find `.ezlog` files empestered almost everywhere.

Yet when ezlog's classic K&R Code inexplicably [disappearing from SourceForge in 2012](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezlog/files/) (yes, I've still got that source code), rather than risk another landmine I simply kept the R&D to myself. 

Yet in my absence, however, lots of folks seemed keen to take over the [`ezlog`](https://www.google.com/search?q=ezlog&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS971US971&oq=ezlog) moniker. Complement.

Since as GitHub has evolved, I updated ezlog to the C/C++ 2014 Standard to [earn a few extra pennies on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/gnu-cpp-2000).

Moving forward & cloned today from that [era Namespace](https://github.com/soft9000/era), the future of the 30 year ezlog command-line interface will be evolving at this location.

# Mission
Evolving across the decades, as ever the mission of **ezlog** remains to:

(1) Allow us to use any **C**ommand **L**ine User **I**nterface (**CLI**) to maintain our events & messages in readily editable text files.

(2) Permit us to work on those files between that **CLI** and a cross-platform **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface (**GUI**.)

(3) Do other [creative things](http://soft9000.com) whilst I am in between [consulting 'gigs](https://linkedin.com/in/nagyspace).

Happy logging!
