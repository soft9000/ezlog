# ezlog
Created & shared back in 1998, the original ezlog logging legacy - lives on!

Part of my classic [AboutTime Desktop Application](https://github.com/soft9000/AboutTime), I've also used ezlog to demonstrate fast & easy logging techniques across Java, Python, PHP, C#, VB.Net, and yes - as well as several incarnations of the C/C++ Standard. From oil & gas compaines, cloud, banking, and skype - to the DoD - you'll find `.ezlog` files empestered almost everywhere.

Yer when ezlog's classic K&R Code inexplicably [disappearing from SourceForge in 2012](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezlog/files/) (yes, I've still got that source code), rather than risk another landmine I simply kept the R&D to myself. Yet in my absence, however, lots of folks seemed keen to take over the `[ezlog](https://www.google.com/search?q=ezlog&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS971US971&oq=ezlog)` moniker. Complement.

Since as GitHub has evolved, I updated ezlog to the C/C++ 2014 Standard to [earn a few extra pennies on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/gnu-cpp-2000).

Moving forward & cloned today from that [era Namespace](https://github.com/soft9000/era), the future of the 30 year ezlog command-line interface will be evolving at this location.

Happy logging!
